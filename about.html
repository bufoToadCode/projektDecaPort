                 <h1>Hi! Thanks for visiting   <a href="https://github.com/bufoToadCode" target="_blank">bufoToadCode's</a>   Website.</h1>

                  <p>
                     Hi! I am <a href="https://github.com/bufoToadCode" target="_blank">bufoToadCode. <sup>github_link</sup></a>  , aspiring as a frontEnd Dev in I.T. Industry Since 2<sup>nd</sup> Dec 2020. With over a decade of familiarity in computer programming, content creation and informal style writing at different levels of education, this is my pilot project as an I.T. professional.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     This is my first portfolio blog website and is still in its infancy. I will be regularly updating this blog website to make it more interactive, with easy-to-use functionality as I learn more about the new technologies. So, do drop by in a whileðŸ™‹. So, Let me brief you on this projectDeca: <br> <li>I have started to built this website by first setting-up the page structure and  choosing a nested-layout style.</li> <li>Dividing the page into 2 blocks- navbar and portfolio item grid.</li> <li>Navbar has 2 links and an author stamp.</li><li>portfolio item-grid includes images, titles, descriptions and transition-animations.</li><br> Though the website is halfway, for the time being, Yes, you get the basic idea. The experience was new to me as I had to build it from scratch and overlooking even 1 error would break the page. I invested a total of 20hrs and more than 15 cups of coffee to present it as you are seeing now. <br> Yes, This whole change in work-attitude would not have been possible without family & friends and ovio my spirit-animal motivation.
                  </p>

                 <p>
