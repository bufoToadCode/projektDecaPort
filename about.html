                 <h1>Hi! Thanks for visiting   <a href="https://github.com/bufoToadCode" target="_blank">bufoToadCode's</a>   Website.</h1>

                  <p>
                     Hi! I am <a href="https://github.com/bufoToadCode" target="_blank">bufoToadCode. <sup>github_link</sup></a>  , working as an amateur frontEnd Dev in I.T. Industry Since 2<sup>nd</sup> Dec 2020. With over a decade of familiarity in computer programming at different levels of education, this is my pilot project as an I.T. professional.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     This is my first portfolio website and is still in its infancy. I will be regularly updating this     website to make it more appealing, with easy-to-use features as I learn more about the new technology. So, do drop by in a whileðŸ™‹. So, Let me brief you on this projectDeca: <br> <li> I have started to built this website by first setting-up the page structure and  choosing a nested-layout style.</li> <li>Dividing the page into 2 blocks- navbar and portfolio item grid.</li> <li>Navbar has 2 links and a coderSymbol.</li><li>protfolio item grid includes images, titles, descriptions, animations and JavaScript.</li><br> Though the website is basic for the time being, the experience was completely amazing to me as I had to build it from scratch and overlooking even 1 error would break the page. I invested a total of 20hrs and more than 15 cups of coffee to make it look as you are seeing now. <br> Yes, This whole change in work-attitude would not have been possible without family & friends and ovio my spirit animal motivation.
                  </p>

                    <u>PS:</u> <br> <br> Bufo Toad is a genus of true toads in the amphibian family Bufonidae. They are known to be bold, aggressive, and very territorial.
